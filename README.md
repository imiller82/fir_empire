This repository contains data used in writing the book:

Fir and Empire: The Transformation of Forests in Early Modern China. 
https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295747330/fir-and-empire/

I intend to provide as much of the data as possible for the use of other researchers. Because these were collected over the course of a decade and from many sources, there are many ideosyncracies.

Some data were input by hand in spreadsheets and may contain material that is not readily processed by scripts.

Files:

PrimarySourceBib.csv - Primary Source Bibliography.

This is intended to be a complete list of primary sources used in the text. Where possible, I have provided links to sources available on the web.
